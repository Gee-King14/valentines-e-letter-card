## How to Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. **Push your project to a GitHub repository**
   - Make sure your main HTML file is named `index.html` and is in the root directory.
   - All assets (images, CSS, JS) should be referenced with relative paths.

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repository's Settings > Pages
   - Select the branch (usually `main` or `master`) and root folder (`/`)
   - Save

3. **Access your site**
   - Your site will be live at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`

## Tips
- For custom domains, configure in GitHub Pages settings.
- If you need a `.gitignore` or want to add more instructions, let me know!

Happy Valentine's Day!
